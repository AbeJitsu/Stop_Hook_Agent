# Stop Hook Learning Project 🎯

A hands-on project to learn how to make Claude Code work reliably until success criteria are met using stop hooks.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a simple counter web application designed specifically for learning how to implement effective validation with Claude Code stop hooks. The project demonstrates how to create a 2-agent system where Claude does the work and a validator ensures completion.

```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** (optional, for advanced validation):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test the stop hook**:
   ```bash
   ./stop-hook-validator.sh
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Stop Hook Effectiveness

### Example Prompts to Test

#### ❌ Vague Prompt (Often Fails)
```
"Make the counter app better"
```

#### ✅ Specific Prompt with Success Criteria
```
Complete this task with these EXACT success criteria:
1. ✅ All HTML elements must be present and valid
2. ✅ CSS styling must be applied correctly
3. ✅ JavaScript counter functionality must work (increment/reset)
4. ✅ All functionality tests must pass: npm run test:functionality
5. ✅ All structure tests must pass: npm run test:structure
6. ✅ No syntax errors in any files

IMPORTANT: You are not done until ALL SIX criteria pass.
After each change, verify by running the tests.

Task: [your specific request here]
```

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Test Incomplete Work Detection**:
   - Temporarily break something (delete a CSS rule)
   - Ask Claude to "fix any issues"
   - See if the stop hook catches the problem

2. **Test Continuous Validation**:
   - Ask Claude to add a new feature
   - Include specific success criteria
   - Watch the stop hook ensure completion

3. **Test Different Prompt Styles**:
   - Compare vague vs. specific instructions
   - Notice how stop hooks help with both

## 🔧 How the Stop Hook Works

### The Validation Process

1. **File Existence Check**: Ensures all required files are present
2. **Content Validation**: Checks HTML/CSS/JS have required elements
3. **Functionality Tests**: Runs automated tests to verify behavior
4. **Structure Tests**: Validates project organization
5. **Success Summary**: Provides clear pass/fail feedback

### Key Components

- **stop-hook-validator.sh**: Main validation script
- **test-functionality.js**: Checks if code actually works
- **test-structure.js**: Validates project structure
- **.claude/settings.json**: Configures the hook

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By experimenting with this project, you'll learn:

1. **How to write effective success criteria** for Claude Code tasks
2. **How stop hooks provide continuous validation** throughout development
3. **How to create automated checks** that catch incomplete work
4. **How to structure prompts** for reliable completion
5. **How to build validation scripts** tailored to your projects

## 💡 Best Practices Discovered

### For Prompting
- Always include specific, measurable success criteria
- List the exact commands that should pass
- Be explicit about what "done" means
- Include validation steps in your request

### For Stop Hooks
- Check multiple aspects (files, content, functionality)
- Provide clear feedback about what failed
- Include helpful next steps in failure messages
- Make validation fast but thorough

### For Project Setup
- Create automated tests for your success criteria
- Structure projects with clear validation points
- Document your success criteria in the hook itself

## 🎮 Advanced Experiments

Once you understand the basics, try these advanced scenarios:

1. **Multi-Agent Review System**: Create a second agent that reviews Claude's work
2. **Progressive Validation**: Build hooks that check different criteria at different stages
3. **Custom Linting**: Add project-specific validation rules
4. **Integration Testing**: Test how the app actually works in a browser

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Experiment** with different prompt styles using this project
2. **Modify** the stop hook to add your own validation criteria
3. **Create** similar validation setups for your real projects
4. **Share** what you learn about effective Claude Code workflows

## 🔗 Useful Commands

```bash
# Test the stop hook manually
./stop-hook-validator.sh

# Run individual test suites
npm run test:functionality
npm run test:structure

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run all validation checks
npm run build
npm run test
```

**Happy Learning!** 🎉

This project gives you a concrete sandbox to experiment with making Claude Code work reliably until completion. The stop hook will catch incomplete work and guide Claude to fix issues until all success criteria are met.
