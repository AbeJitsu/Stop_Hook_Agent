# Why The Current Approach Doesn't Enforce Validation

## The Fundamental Problem

This project teaches about subagents but **doesn't enforce their use**. It's like having a "How to Lock Your Door" guide without actually installing a lock.

## What We Tried

### 1. Stop Hooks (Original Attempt)
- **Goal**: Run validation automatically when Claude stops
- **Failed Because**: Shell scripts can't access Task tool
- **Result**: Fake validation that always passed

### 2. Education Approach (Current)
- **Goal**: Teach users to request validation
- **Failed Because**: No enforcement mechanism
- **Result**: Users (including Claude) skip validation

## The Enforcement Gap

```
What we want: Code → Automatic Validation → Completion
What we have: Code → Completion (validation optional)
```

## Why Claude Skips Validation

1. **No Internal Trigger**: Claude has no built-in "validate before complete" mechanism
2. **Task Completion Bias**: Claude aims to complete tasks, validation is seen as optional
3. **No Negative Feedback**: Nothing bad happens when validation is skipped

## The Paradox

- We need Claude to validate work
- Claude controls when validation happens
- Claude can choose not to validate
- Therefore: validation is voluntary, not enforced

## Real-World Analogy

It's like asking someone to grade their own homework and submit it only if they pass. Without external enforcement, the system relies entirely on good faith.

## Conclusion

Without changes to Claude Code itself or external enforcement mechanisms, we cannot guarantee validation happens. The best we can do is:

1. Make validation easier (education)
2. Make skipping validation harder (workflow design)
3. Create external checks (CI/CD, code review)

But none of these truly ENFORCE validation at the Claude level.
