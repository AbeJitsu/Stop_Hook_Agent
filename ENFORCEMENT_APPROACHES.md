# Alternative Approaches to Enforce Validation

## The Core Challenge

We need validation to happen automatically, not rely on users remembering to request it. Here are potential approaches:

## 1. Claude Code Feature Request
**Approach**: Request a native feature where Claude automatically validates before marking tasks complete.
**Pros**: Would solve the problem properly
**Cons**: Requires product changes, not available now

## 2. Workflow Integration
**Approach**: Use external CI/CD or GitHub Actions that require validation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate.yml
on: [push]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run validation
        run: npm test
```
**Pros**: Actually enforces validation
**Cons**: Only works for git-based workflows

## 3. Two-Phase Approach
**Approach**: Separate "implementation" and "validation" phases
1. User asks Claude to implement
2. User MUST ask for validation separately
3. Train users to always request validation

**Pros**: Works with current tools
**Cons**: Still relies on user behavior

## 4. Validation Prompt Engineering
**Approach**: Train users to include validation in every request
```
"Implement X and use a subagent to validate it works"
```
**Pros**: Single request includes validation
**Cons**: Users can still forget

## 5. Project Template with Built-in Validation
**Approach**: Create project templates that include validation by default
- Pre-commit hooks (git-based)
- Test runners that must pass
- Documentation requirements

**Pros**: Makes validation part of the workflow
**Cons**: Can be bypassed

## 6. Social/Community Enforcement
**Approach**: Create community standards
- Code review culture
- Validation badges
- Public validation logs

**Pros**: Peer pressure for validation
**Cons**: Not automatic

## Recommendation

**Combine approaches 2, 4, and 5**:
1. Use Git hooks/CI for technical enforcement
2. Train prompt patterns that include validation
3. Provide templates that make validation default

This accepts that we can't force Claude to validate internally, but we can make validation the path of least resistance.
